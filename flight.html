            <p>Hummingbird flight has been studied intensively from an aerodynamic<br> perspective using wind tunnels and high-speed video cameras. Two<br> studies of rufous or Anna's hummingbirds in a wind tunnel used particle<br> image velocimetry techniques to investigate the lift generated on the<br> bird's upstroke and downstroke. The birds produced 75% of their weight<br> support during the downstroke and 25% during the upstroke, with the<br> wings making a "figure 8" motion.</p>

            <p>One of the most useful flight adaptions of the hummingbird is its<br> wingbeat and flight stability. The highest recorded wingbeat rate for<br> hummingbirds during hovering is 99.1 per second, as measured for male<br> woodstars (Chaetocercus sp.). Males in the genus Chaetocercus have<br> been recorded above 100 beats per second during courtship displays.<br> During turbulent airflow conditions created experimentally in a wind<br> tunnel, hummingbirds exhibit stable head positions and orientation when<br> they hover at a feeder. Their ability to hover allows them to feed.</p>
            <p>Another useful flight adaption of the hummingbird is its wing feather<br> trill. Male rufous and broad-tailed hummingbirds (genus Selasphorus)<br> have a distinctive wing feature during normal flight that sounds like<br> jingling or a buzzing shrill whistle -- a trill. The trill arises from air<br> rushing through slots created by the tapered tips of the ninth and tenth<br> primary wing feathers, creating a sound loud enough to be detected by<br> female or competitive male hummingbirds and researchers up to 100<br> metres away. This adaptation allows hummingbirds to find a mate using<br> their wings.</p>
