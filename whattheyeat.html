            <p>All hummingbirds are nectarivorous and are the most specialized of<br> bird species. Hummingbirds have numerous adaptations to nectarivory,<br> including long, probing bills and tongues which rapidly take up fluids.<br> Hummingbirds also posses the most advanced and sophisticated<br> hovering flight of all birds. Their intestines are capable of extracting<br> over 99% of the glucose from nectar feedings within minutes, owing to<br> high densities of glucose transporters (the highest known among<br> vertebrates)</p>

            <h3>Adaptations</h3>
            <hr>
            <img src="hummingbirdbeak.jpg" alt="A curved hummingbird beak" id="beakA">
            <p>One of the hummingbirds most useful adaptiations for feeding are their<br> beaks. The extreme curved beaks of sicklebills are adapted for extracting<br> nectar from the curved corolla tubes of Centropogon flowers. Some<br> species, such as hermits (Phaethornis spp.), have long beaks that enable<br> insertion deeply into flowers with long corolla tubes. Thornbills have<br> short, sharp beaks adapted for feeding from flowers with short corolla<br> tubes and piercing the bases of longer ones. The beak of the fiery-tailed<br> awlbill has an upturned tip adapted for feeding on nectar from tubular<br> flowers while hovering.</p>

            <p>Another useful adaptation that the hummingbird uses for feeding is<br> their specialized tounge. Hummingbirds drink with their long tongues<br> by rapidly lapping nectar. Their tongues have semicircular tubes which<br> run down their lengths to facilitate nectar consumption via rapid<br> pumping in and out of the nectar. While capillary action was believed to<br> be what drew nectar into these tubes, high-speed photography revealed<br> that the tubes open down their sides as the tongue goes into the nectar,<br> and then close around the nectar, trapping it so it can be pulled back into<br> the beak over a period of 14 milliseconds per lick at a rate of up to 20<br> licks per second. The tongue, which is forked, is compressed until it<br> reaches nectar, then the tongue springs open. This allows them to unload<br> nectar via a pump.</p>
            <p>Other adaptations include their:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Wingbeats and flight stability</li>
              <li>Perception of sweet nectar</li>
              <li>Visual cues of foraging</li>
              <li>Feeders and artificial nectar</li>
              <li>And others</li>
